# nosql-challenge

This project aims to perform analysis on a NoSQL database containing information about food establishments. 
The database contains data such as establishment names, addresses, hygiene scores, ratings, and more. 
The analysis involves querying the database, performing aggregations, and extracting insights to improve food safety and quality standards.

To run the analysis, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the pymongo library for interacting with MongoDB. 
You can install pymongo using pip-->pip install pymongo
You also need access to a MongoDB instance where the food establishment database is hosted.
